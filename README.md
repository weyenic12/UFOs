## Overview of the Analysis
- We were given the task of adding a more in-depth analysis for the UFO sightings by enabling the option to search with filters to get more accurate data. We added additional filters from the date filter including city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
- With the new webpage, you can now filter UFO sightings through the date, city, state, country, and shape. Previously, the webpage only had a filter for date. It is a simple as putting in the information in the bars on the left hand of the webpage, which can be seen in the two photos above in the Resources section, and clicking on the webpage or pressing enter to refresh the webpage with your filtered results.

## Summary
- One drawback of the webpage is formatting and design. It is cleaner and easier to narrow down search results; however, it could still use more formatting and design to clean up the webpage even more. 
- One feature that would be fun to add would be submissions from the public with their ufo encounter and attach pictures to those who have them. This way we could grow the database. Another idea could be adding more information to each encounter, also adding more pictures and design on the webpage overall.
